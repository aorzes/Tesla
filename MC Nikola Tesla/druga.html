        <h1>Tesla's biography</h1>
        <p align="justify">
        In 1885 George Westinghouse (the owner of the Westinghouse Electric Company) bought the rights to Tesla's polyphase dynamo generators, transformers and motors. Soon, Tesla began to conduct various experiments in his lab that he showed to the public, like turning on the lights without a wire. He allowed the electricity to flow through his body in order to lessen the fears of alternating current. One of his glorious inventions is the Tesla coil, which is now widely used in radios, televisions and other electronic equipment. At the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, in 1893, Westinghouse used Tesla's lighting systems. That success was an important factor in obtaining a contract to set up his power plant at Niagara Falls, which was practically the beginning of the electrification of the world. In 1898 at Madison Square Garden Tesla unveiled a boat that could be managed with the help of a remote device.<br/> <img src='teslaBoatc.png' width=100%>In Colorado Springs Tesla discovered what he considered his greatest discovery and that were the terrestrial stationary waves. He has discovered that the land can be used as an electricity conductor. He managed to light 200 lamps at a distance of 40 kilometers. He also managed to create artificial lightning.
