        Tesla allegedly cooperated with the U.S. government and other scientists on the production of weapons that would give the U.S. supremacy in the war against the Nazi. Thus, there are theories that he invented the 'death ray'. Allegedly they managed to achieve the invisibility of one American ship, and they even managed to teleport it. He died in 1943 and the U.S. government took over all of his records and research. Even today, people can't take the advantage of all his designs because they are far ahead of our time.<br/>
